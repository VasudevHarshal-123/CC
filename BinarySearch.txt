Binary Search
Given a sorted array A[](0 based index) and a key "k"  you need to complete the function bin_search to  
determine the position of the key if the key is present in the array. If the key is not  present then you have to return -1. 
The arguments left and right denotes the left most index  and right most index of the array A[]. 
There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this function will be called individually.

Approach:STL lower_bound gives that element.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 200

Example:
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 4 5 
4
5
11 22 33 44 55
445

Output:
3
-1



int bin_search(int A[], int left, int right, int k)
{
    int N=right+1;
    auto it = lower_bound(A,A+N,k);
    if(*it!=k)				//If element not there it returns just greater number which can fail hence this condition
        return -1;	
    if(it!=A+N)
    return it-A;  //0 based indexing
    return -1;
}
