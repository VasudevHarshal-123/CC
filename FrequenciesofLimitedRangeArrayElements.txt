Frequencies of Limited Range Array Elements 
Given an array A[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to N where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. 
Your task is to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N.

Approach:Every time an element occurs add n to that elements index. Also, we do %n because if the index where it is presents element occur before it would have added
	 n at that index.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 4*104 
1 <= A[i] <= N

Example: 
Sample Input:
2
5
2 3 2 3 5
4
3 3 3 3

Sample Output:
0 2 2 0 1
0 0 4 0




void frequencycount(vector<int>&arr, int n)
{
    for(int i = 0;i<n;i++){
        arr[i]--;
    }
    
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        arr[arr[i]%n]+=n;
    }
    
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        arr[i]=arr[i]/n;
    }
    
}
