Rightmost different bit 
Given two numbers M and N. The task is to find the position of rightmost different bit in binary representation of numbers.

Expected Time Complexity: O(max(log m, log n)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= M <= 103
1 <= N <= 103

Example:
Input:
2
11 9
52 4

Output:
2
5

Explanation:
Tescase 1: Binary representaion of the given numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 2nd bit from right is different.
Testcase 2: Binary representation of the given numbers are:  ‭110100‬ and 0100, 5th bit fron right is different.

EX: 54^4 = 10000 = 48
	Then find first set bit using log2 formula.


int posOfRightMostDiffBit(int m, int n)
{
    int x=m^n;
    return x==0?0:log2((x^(x-1))+1);
    // Your code here
    
    
}
