Maximum Water Between Two Buildings
Given an integer array representing the heights of N buildings, the task is to delete N-2 buildings such that 
the water that can be trapped between the remaining two building is maximum.

Note: The total water trapped between two buildings is gap between them (number of buildings removed) multiplied by height of the smaller building.

APPROACH: USe of two pointer algo, The most water can be captured at minimum building height of both side * distance, the maximum such value will be output.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).



For Input:

// Return the maximum water that can be stored 
int maxWater(int h[], int n) 
{ 
    int maximum=-1,minimum,start=0,end=n-1;
    
    while(start<end){
        minimum=min(h[start],h[end]);
        if(h[start]>=h[end]){
            maximum=max(minimum*(end-start-1),maximum);
            end--;
        }
        else{
            maximum=max(minimum*(end-start-1),maximum);
            start++;
        }
    }
    return maximum;
}
