Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Approach:Use of set because array can have -ve element array based indexing would be difficult. in else{ count = 1} 
because we have to count the element we are starting from
[-1,0,1 3,4,5,6,7,8,9] Here, when start from 3 we count three as well hence count = 1;

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
       int max=0,count=0,output=0,min=INT_MAX;
        set<int>s;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();++i){
           if(nums[i]<min)
                min=nums[i];
       }   
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();++i){
            s.insert(nums[i]);
        }
        
        
        int temp=min;
        for(auto x:s){
            if(x==temp+1 ||x==temp){
               count++;  
                temp=x;
                if(count>output)
                    output=count;
            }
            else{
                temp=x;
                count=1;
            } 
                        
        }
        
        return output;
    }
};
