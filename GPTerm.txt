GP Term
Given the first 2 terms A and B of a Geometric Series. The task is to find the Nth term of the series.

Approach: Double is for explicit type conversion as A and B is in integer type.  Floor is also used.

Expected Time Complexity : O(logN)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
-100 <= A <= 100
-100 <= B <= 100
1 <= N <= 5

Example:
Input:
2
2 3
1
1 2
2
Output:
2
2


double termOfGP(int A,int B,int N)
{
    double r = (double)B/A;   
    return floor(A*pow(r,(N-1)));
}
