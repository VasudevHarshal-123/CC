Find first set bit 
Given an integer an N. The task is to print the position of first set bit found from the right side in the binary representation of the number.

Approach:Keep shifting right till find one.

unsigned int getFirstSetBit(int n){
    int count=1;
    while(n>0){
        if(n&1==1)
            return count;
        n=n>>1;
        count++;
    }
    return 0;
}

OR
unsigned int ans= (n==0)?0: log2((n^(n-1))+1);

EX: 6 = 110 

   6^5 = 100 =4+1=5

	log2(5)=2.3= 2      in ques there is indexing from 1
