Check whether K-th bit is set or not 
Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. 
Position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.
Example, Consider N = 4(100):  0th bit = 0, 1st bit = 0, 2nd bit = 1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
0 ≤ K ≤ floor(log2(N) + 1)

Example:
Input:
3
4
0
4
2
500
3

Output:
No
Yes
No

bool checkKthBit(int n, int k){
    
    int x = n>>k;

    if((x&1)==1)
    return true;

    return false;
    
}		

OR return (n>>k)&1;
