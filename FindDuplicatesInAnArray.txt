Find duplicates in an array
Given an array a[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, you need to find all the elements occurring more than once in the given array.

Approach: Count the element. As elements<=n-1 O(n) count and return vector where count>1 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).
Note : The extra space is only for the array to be returned.
Try and perform all operation withing the provided array. 

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= A[i] <= N-1, for each valid i

Example:
Sample Input:
2
4
0 3 1 2
5
2 3 1 2 3 

Sample Output:
-1
2 3 



vector<int> duplicates(int arr[], int n) {
    vector<int>v;
    int max= n;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        arr[arr[i]%n]+=n;
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        arr[i]=arr[i]/n;
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
       if(arr[i]>1)
            v.push_back(i);
    }
    if(v.empty())
        v.push_back(-1);
    return v;
}
