Set Bits 
Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. For example, if the given number is 6(binary: 110), output should be 2 as there are two set bits in it.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 106

Example:
Input:
2
6
11
Output:
2
3



    while(test--){
        ll size,input;
        vector<int>vect;
        
        cin>>size;
        cout<<__builtin_popcount(size)<<endl;
        
        
    }
