Binary Tree Pruning

We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

I/P			O/P
[1,1,0,0,1,0,0] = [1,1,0,null,null,1]

REMOVE NODE MANUALLY AND DELETE THEM AFTER REMOVING. TO DELETE WE NEED TO KEEP REFRENCE AND CUT LINK THEN ONLY DELETE POSSIBLE
