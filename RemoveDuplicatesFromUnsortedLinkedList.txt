Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list 
Given an unsorted linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List. 
When a value appears in multiple nodes, the node which appeared first should be kept, all others duplicates are to be removed.

input:5,2,4,2
outp: 5 2 4

Approach: As an elment occurs 1st time increase its count and as it occurs more than one time remove it

Node * removeDuplicates( Node *head) 
{
    
    Node* t1=head,*t2=head;
    int arr[10001]={0};
    
    // while(t1->next!=NULL){
    //     arr[t1->data]++;
    //     t1=t1->next;
    // }
    // t1=head;
    while(t2->next!=NULL){
        arr[t2->data]++;
        t2=t2->next;
        if(arr[t2->data]>0){
            t1->next=t2->next;
            // t2=t1->next;
        }
        else{
            t1=t1->next;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
