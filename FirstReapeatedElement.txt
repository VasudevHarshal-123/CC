First Repeating Element
Given an array arr[] of size N. The task is to find the first repeating element in an array of integers, i.e., 
an element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.

Approach: look at test case explanation.
	
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 500
1 <= N <= 106
0 <= Ai <= 106

Expected Time Complexity : O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(N)

Example:

Input:
3
7
1 5 3 4 3 5 6
4
1 2 3 4
5
1 2 2 1 3

Output:
2
-1
1

Explanation: 
Testcase 1: 5 is appearing twice and its first appearence is at index 2 which is less than 3 whose first occuring index is 3.
Testcase 2: All elements appear only once so -1 is printed.
Tescase 3:  The element 1 appears more than 1 times and is the first element to do so. So, we print its index 1.

int firstRepeated(int arr[], int n) {



    vector<int>v(1000001,0);
    int repeated=-1;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        v[arr[i]]++;
    }

    
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(v[arr[i]]>1)
            return i+1;
    }
 
    return -1;  
    
}
