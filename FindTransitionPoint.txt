Find Transition Point
You are given a sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1. 
Find the transition point efficiently. Transition point is a point where "0" ends and "1" begins (0 based indexing).
Note that, if there is no "1" exists, print -1.

Approach: upper_bound for array returns iterator. it-arr gives index 

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 500000
0 ≤ C[i] ≤ 1
Example:

Input
2
5
0 0 0 1 1
4
0 0 0 0

Output
3
-1

int transitionPoint(int arr[], int n) {
    auto it = upper_bound(arr,arr+n,0);
    if(it==arr+n)
        return -1;
    return it-arr;				//Gives index;
}
